# Personal-Health-Assistant


Over the years the healthcare sector has seen significant advances in terms of
diagnosis and prediction of various chronic diseases with machine learning. Since
healthcare industry produces huge amount of varied data, which proves favorable for
a machine learning model for predicting results with great accuracy and efficiency.
With this knowledge, we propose a “Personal Health Assistant”.
When a person is infected with a disease, he is bound to suffer from various
symptoms. Some of the symptoms are unique to a particular disease while many show
mixed symptoms of two or more disease. During the early phases of disease, it
becomes ambiguous to predict which disease a person is afflicted with. So, our web
application will use various machine learning algorithms that would take symptoms of
the person as input and predict the probabilities of various diseases he or she is
suffering with. The output of model would give the chances of all the diseases that he
or she may suffer with. Thus, enabling a person to have a better insight of his
condition.<br/>
		Depending on the severity of his/her disease, the model would suggest the necessity
for a doctor checkup. This would be made easier by showing the nearby physicians
and hospitals around him using Geo Location Google map. Once the person has
visited the doctor, with our web app, he can know the comparative prices of various
pharmacies providing the same prescription. Thus, allowing people to make wise and
feasible choice.
Thus, this system would make a person more aware about his/her health condition and
choose feasible drugs over costlier drugs.
